# Compartmental models parallel GPU-Cuda fitting toolbox

GPU-CUDA toolbox for fitting compartmental models to 4D medical dynamic volumes.
It uses pyCUDA and cuBLAS python interfaces to parallelize the LM non-linear optimization algorithm.

### TODO
- Add instruction to how to install the library
- Add instruction of how to use the class
- Add some ipython notebooks with examples
